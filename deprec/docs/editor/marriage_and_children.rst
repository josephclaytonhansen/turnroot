S-Supports, Marriage, and Children
##################################
Basic Guidelines
-----------------
S-Supports
==========
In this genre of game, S-Support is the highest level of romantic relationship you can develop. It's usually analogous to "marriage". For brevity's sake, I'll refer to marriage or romantic relationships that can bear children as "S-Supports".

Each unit can only have S support with one unit- once they reach S support with a unit, no other units will be able to gain S support, even if they have the potential for it. 

Children
=========
A child unit comes from two units with an S support level- they have an average of their parents’ stats, classes, and skills. For example, if Test Unit A has 19 strength when they gain S support with Test Unit, who has 8 strength, their child unit will have 14 strength.

A child unit will gain most of their traits from their mother, or from the unit that “Can be pregnant.” Each unit that “Can be pregnant” has a child unit assigned to them, and they will always have this child no matter who the partner is. The partner contributes hair color, as well as stats/skills, etc. Thus, a unit that “Can impregnate” determines hair color in their union.

Two units can only have children if one unit "Can impregnate" and one unit "Can be pregnant". An S support level is not a guarantee of a child unit. 

Pronouns have no effect whatsoever on children units. A unit with "she/her" pronouns can impregnate if you set her to "Can impregnate." Pronouns only affect dialogue. 

What are the options for how all this works?
----------------------------------------------
Children can be disabled entirely in the Game Editor. S-Supports can't be *technically* disabled, at least not with one click. However, in order for an S-Support to take place, the max relationship level between a unit and another unit must be S. In other words, if a unit has NO max S-Support levels with any unit, that unit cannot S-Support. "No duh!", you might say- yes, I know, but consider this: if no units have max S-Support with any units, no S-Supports can happen. You can completely disable S-Supports this way.

When S-Supports happen
=======================
As the game creator, you can choose whether S-Supports can happen at any time, or if they must all wait for a game event. If you choose the second option, *all S-Supports will happen at the same time*. The user will choose which unit will S-Support the protagonist, and the rest of the units are divvied up as their support levels dictate. This is how *Fire Emblem: Three Houses* handles S-Supports. 

What happens when an S-Support takes place
===========================================
You can now choose what happens after an S-Support. If you enable children units in the Game Editor, your S-Supported units will spend some intimate time together (or at least, such is the implication) which will result in a baby. Babies are very cool but entirely useless in combat, so this presents a small difficulty- what is the point of having children if they can't do anything? (The context of you making a *combat* based game is crucially important here.) 

*Fire Emblem: Awakening* (and *Fates*) came up with an ingenious solution. It works well enough that Turnroot does the same thing. Specifically, when an S-Support happens, a new paralogue battle is unlocked, where you meet the fully grown child on some half-explained journey from the future and recruit them to fight with you. It doesn't really make sense, but that's ok! It works. 

Notice that the option to have children and the option for children to have paralogue battles are separate in the game editor. You don't *have* to have a paralogue battle for these units!

What happens if you don't? The child unit (fully grown) is added to the *game*, but not to the team *roster*. They're still assigned a status of "Recruitable Ally", so you could insert them into any random map and make them recruitable that way. 

Here's a simple decision tree for all this: 

**Can S-Supports produce children? If yes, do children have paralogue battles? If yes, they get their own battle. If no, they show up in a "main" battle, or they never show up at all. Your call.**

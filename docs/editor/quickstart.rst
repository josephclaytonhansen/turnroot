Getting Started with the Turnroot Builder
==========================================

System requirements
--------------------------
The Turnroot Editor is not super resource intensive. You should be able to run it on any computer. With that said, you should have a monitor with a display resolution of at least 1920x1080. While not required, you'll have to resize the windows to fit on a smaller monitor, and you may have to scroll to see everything. You'll also find having at least 4 GB of RAM will reduce load times slightly. 

On older or less powerful computers, you may notice a short delay from when you open the Turnroot Builder to when it actually opens. This is normal- no cause for worry!

Getting Started with the Turnroot Builder
==========================================

.. _sysreqs:
System requirements
--------------------------
The Turnroot Editor is not super resource intensive. You should be able to run it on any computer. With that said, you should have a monitor with a display resolution of at least 1920x1080. While not required, you'll have to resize the windows to fit on a smaller monitor, and you may have to scroll to see everything. You'll also find having at least 4 GB of RAM will reduce load times slightly. 

On older or less powerful computers, you may notice a short delay from when you open the Turnroot Builder to when it actually opens. This is normal- no cause for worry!

The first look: Turnroot Editor at a glance

The first time you open the Turnroot Builder, this is what you'll see (minus, of course, the A-F labels):

This view is the **Game Editor**. This editor is where you set essential attributes of your game. We'll dive into the Game Editor in the next document, but for now, let's focus on what's happening here. 

A: Editor Selection
--------------------
Click this button to change which editor you're currently using. You can also press **Esc** to open editor selection. Right now, if you try to click on this, it won't let you. You can't change editors until your game has a name and a folder; we'll get to that in a second. 

B: Options
-----------
Click this to open options. These are editor specific; different editors have different options. There are a few constants, though. You can always change the color theme, font size, icon size, and other appearance-related settings. You can also find error logs (for bug reporting.) Check out :doc: `customizing` to learn more about the options dialog.

C: Help

D: Save status

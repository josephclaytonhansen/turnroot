Using the Unit/Class Editor, Part 3
=====================================

Creating a new unit
------------------------
We're going to go ahead and create a generic enemy unit now. I'd like to mention now this is not a normal workflow- the unit editor is designed to work on one unit at a time, to completion, and this is the way you should do it in future. 

To create a new unit, you'll need to close the Turnroot builder and re-open it. You can open a saved unit at any point, but you can't create a new unit if you're already editing one. This is a safeguard to prevent accidental overrides. (You can probably see now why it's recommended to work on one unit at a time.)

Go ahead and close /re-open the builder. This time, you'll open up to the Unit Editor instead of the Game Editor. In future, you'll always open to the Unit Editor unless you change your default editor or start work on a new game. 

At this point, you're fully equipped to create the skeleton of a new unit- go ahead and do that, following the steps from the previous tutorial, and save it as "Test Enemy". This time, you can do whatever you want with the basic settings and weapon affinities, this tutorial is only going to talk about AI and Generic. Don't forget to set the unit to be an **Enemy** in the drop-down and turn on the **Generic** checkbox, like this:

I've made my enemy unit a "monster", just for giggles.

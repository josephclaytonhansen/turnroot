S-Supports, Marriage, and Children
##################################
Basic Guidelines
-----------------
S-Supports
==========
Each unit can only have S support with one unit- once they reach S support with a unit, no other units will be able to gain S support, even if they have the potential for it. 

Children
=========
   A child unit comes from two units with an S support level- they have an average of their parents’ stats, classes, and skills. For example, if Test Unit A has 19    strength when they gain S support with Test Unit, who has 8 strength, their child unit will have 14 strength.

   A child unit will gain most of their traits from their mother, or from the unit that “Can be pregnant.” Each unit that “Can be pregnant” has a child unit            assigned to them, and they will always have this child no matter who the partner is. The partner contributes hair color, as well as stats/skills etc. Thus, a        unit that “Can impregnate” determines hair color in their union.

Two units can only have children if one unit "Can impregnate" and one unit "Can be pregnant". An S support level is not a guarantee of a child unit. 

Pronouns have no effect whatsoever on children units. A unit with "she/her" pronouns can impregnate if you set her to "Can impregnate." Pronouns only affect dialogue.
